				<p class="with-image"><img id="employee" src="image/employees/kunal.jpg" alt="Kunal Patel" title="Kunal Patel" align="left" />I qualified in 2010 from The University of Sheffield. I enjoy carrying out all aspects of Dentistry, and my passion and area of expertise is adult orthodontics and cosmetic dentistry. Since qualifying I have attended many post-graduate courses worldwide to further my knowledge in the dental field. I have sat and passed post graduate royal college of surgeon exams and am continually studying, attending courses and pushing myself to further my knowledge in the dental field.</p>
<p>For me, being a dentist is all about getting to know my patients and understanding their dental concerns – it's not just about performing the treatment itself. I care about what I do, and endeavour to work to the best of my abilities in providing service and quality dental care to my patients.</p>
                <p>I have completed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>12 month certificate course with Chris Orr in advanced cosmetic dentistry</li>
                    <li>Yorkshire Sedation training</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I am certified provider of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Six Month Smile</li>
                    <li>Smilelign</li>

                    <li>IAS Clear Brace</li>

                </ul>
                <p>As well as these certification courses, I have attended numerous one or two day shorter courses and lectures around the UK.</p>
                <p>If I'm not behind a dental chair, you will find me either trying to go to the gym or in the driving range trying to make it on the golf course!</p>
